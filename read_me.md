## Now that I've learned how to use it, I might as well do a better read_me file?

It's not easy being a py n00b.
So many things to learn and so little time to do it.
Hoping to create a whole saler discount file convertor, to help make my work day a little more efficient.
Basically it will mostly consist of text parsing and for version 1, I'm only looking to create scripts to run. Nothing fancy.
Vesion 1 will also be targetted to whole salers in Denmark at the moment.

Current version 0.01 (Haven't added any code to GitHub yet)
